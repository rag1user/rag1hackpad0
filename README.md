# Rag's macropad with 4 switches and 2 LEDs and additional LED controller/strip

This is my first blueprint project with a modest change on top of the instructions provided
I added a Neopixel_txt LED controller that can connect to additional LEDs or an LED strip for some fancy lighting. I also tried to hook up a buzzer but gave up in the interest of time

Here is the schematic. I played around a bit with placement to help routing easier, although kicad didnt make good use of it!!
